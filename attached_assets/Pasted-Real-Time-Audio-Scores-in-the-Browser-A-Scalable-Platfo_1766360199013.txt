Real-Time Audio Scores in the Browser: A Scalable Platform for Networked Mobile Performance
Draft Abstract: We present a web-based audio scoring platform that enables real-time distributed music performance using only standard web browsers on mobile devices. The system offers two modes: (1) a live audio score mode, where a conductor transmits musical parameters (pitch, tempo, timing cues) via WebSockets to multiple players’ phones, which then generate sound locally with Web Audio (Tone.js) in sync; and (2) a synchronized multi-track playback mode, in which the conductor assigns pre-recorded MP3 tracks to each player and triggers tight, simultaneous playback across all clients. The conductor’s interface is a browser-based dashboard (with OSC integration for Max/MSP) that visualizes a circular score and provides global control. We discuss the technical design that addresses challenges of network latency, timing alignment, and scalability in browser-based scoring. The tool’s contribution is to enable large-scale, setup-free performances – turning audience smartphones into an orchestra – and to extend prior concepts of audio scores[1][2] with a new, accessible web platform. An illustrative artistic use case (a sonification of a quantum harmonic oscillator) is described to demonstrate the system in practice. The paper is structured to balance technical exposition and artistic context, following the style of prior TENOR works (e.g., Schimana 2019, Bhagwati 2018, Eldridge 2016), and emphasizes how this platform solves practical coordination problems in networked music using ubiquitous technology.
1. Introduction
Context and Motivation: Introduce the concept of networked musical scores and the need for synchronized, distributed notation/performance in contemporary composition. Note that traditional visual scores or click-tracks have limitations in flexibility and performer engagement[3]. Recent explorations of audio scores (Schimana’s Sound as Score[1], Bhagwati’s “advanced audio scores”[4]) show that using sound as the medium of notation can transcend the limits of written sheets and allow precise timing control[2]. However, implementing such audio-based scores for large groups typically required custom hardware or complex setups.
Gap and Novelty: Highlight the lack of scalable, easy-to-deploy tools for real-time audio scoring. Prior dynamic or animated notation systems (e.g., Fischer’s animated notation[5] or the Decibel ScorePlayer on iPad[6]) often rely on dedicated apps or visual cues, which classically trained musicians may be hesitant to adopt[5]. Networked scores on tablets (Eldridge et al. 2016) improved ensemble coordination in educational settings[7], but were primarily visual and required specific devices (iPads, Bluetooth networks). Our approach instead uses web technology and audio generation to create a setup-free system: any smartphone with a browser can become a musical node. This directly answers calls for non-visual notation systems (audio scores) in networked performance[8].
Contributions: Summarize the paper’s main contributions: (1) the design of a web-based real-time audio score system using Tone.js and WebSockets, allowing conductors to “play” an ensemble of phones live; (2) a synchronized multi-track playback module for distributed audio diffusion across clients; (3) technical strategies for clock synchronization and OSC interoperability; and (4) an example artistic application illustrating the system’s creative potential. Emphasize that the tool enables large ensembles or audiences to participate with minimal setup, expanding possibilities for participatory and distributed music performances.
Paper Structure: Provide a roadmap for the reader. For example: Section 2 describes the system architecture and technical implementation of both modes. Section 3 discusses an artistic use case that demonstrates the tool in practice. Section 4 examines the challenges, innovations, and how this work relates to prior efforts in networked notation and audio scores. Section 5 concludes with implications and future developments.
2. System Design and Implementation
This section details the technical architecture of the web-based scoring tool, divided into two primary modes of operation.
2.1 Architecture Overview: - Roles and Components: Explain the two user roles – Conductor and Player – and the overall client–server architecture. The system is built with a Node.js/Express backend and uses Socket.IO (WebSockets) for real-time messaging between the conductor’s browser and multiple player clients[9]. The frontend is a browser interface (built with web frameworks such as React or vanilla JS) served by the same server. Each player device (typically a mobile phone) runs a Web Audio synthesizer (via Tone.js library[10]) and a canvas-based visualizer, while the conductor’s device runs a control dashboard. This architecture leverages only standard web technologies, avoiding any native app installation. (We may include a simple figure of the system architecture showing the server, conductor UI, player UIs, and communication channels.) - Synchronization Backbone: Describe how time synchronization is handled generally. Both modes use a lightweight clock sync mechanism: when a player connects, it exchanges ping-pong timestamps with the server to estimate client–server time offset[11][12]. This offset allows the server to send out events stamped with a unified time reference. The goal is to ensure that all clients act on conductor signals at the same intended moment, compensating for network latency. We note that this is not an absolute perfect sync (given typical internet jitter), but it achieves sub-100ms precision, sufficient for tight rhythmic coordination in practice. We contrast this with more complex approaches (e.g., NTP or external sync services) and explain why our simpler approach is adequate for the scale and scenarios (browser constraints, etc.).
2.2 Live Audio Score Mode (Real-Time Synthesis): - Conductor Interface: The conductor’s web dashboard provides real-time controls for each player. Describe the UI elements: a list of connected players (each identified by name or slot) and per-player controls such as a pitch slider and tempo/interval slider[13][14]. The conductor can adjust a player’s parameters on the fly; these changes are instantly sent via WebSocket and reflected in the player’s device. The dashboard also visualizes a global circular timeline (a stylized “clock-face” score) to help the conductor see the tempo and cue points. (If multiple conductors are allowed, mention that the system syncs their view and controls collaboratively, though typically one conductor is active). - Player Experience: When the audio score scene is active (and at least one conductor is connected), each player’s phone displays a circular animated score: a rotating hand or indicator moves around a clock-like circle[15]. At the 12 o’clock position, a “trigger point” is marked; each time the rotating hand reaches this point, a note event is triggered[16]. The phone’s speaker then plays a synthesized tone (using Tone.Synth with a short ADSR envelope) at the pitch specified by the conductor[17]. The circle visualization provides immediate feedback: the trigger point pulses when a note plays, and the current note’s name (e.g., “A4”) is prominently displayed[18]. The interval between triggers (rotation speed) is also controlled by the conductor per player, effectively setting that player’s tempo (e.g., one player might have a slow 2000 ms cycle, another a fast 500 ms cycle). - Real-Time Communication and Scheduling: Emphasize the system’s ability to deliver these score instructions with minimal latency and aligned timing. When the conductor moves a slider, the update is broadcast immediately; the player receives a playerUpdate message with new parameters[19][20]. To avoid jitter in audible timing, the client does not trigger sound immediately on message receipt but uses Tone.js’s scheduling: we update the parameters and schedule the next note trigger according to the globally synced phase. Mention the phase alignment strategy: the server periodically broadcasts a reference “phase start” timestamp to all players[11]. Each client aligns the rotation of its clock-hand such that a trigger will occur exactly at that next phase time (taking into account its local offset)[21]. This means that if the conductor sets all players to the same interval, their notes will hit in unison at the top of each cycle. Even with different intervals, the phase reference ensures a coherent downbeat across the ensemble whenever cycles coincide. This design draws inspiration from click-track synchronization but implemented through web timing mechanisms[2]. We also note practical considerations: for example, to satisfy mobile browser audio policies, each player must tap a “Start” button once to enable audio playback (resume AudioContext)[22]—after that, the system can play notes autonomously. - OSC Integration: Briefly describe the built-in OSC (Open Sound Control) interface that allows external applications (like Max/MSP or SuperCollider) to drive the system. The Node.js server runs an OSC UDP listener[23]; the protocol supports messages to set any player’s pitch or interval, or to change scenes[24][25]. This means a composer could, for instance, use a Max patch or algorithmic composition system to send OSC messages that dynamically control the web-based score in real time. This integration extends the system’s flexibility, enabling hybrid setups (e.g., using live sensor data or complex generative processes from Max to influence the browser clients).
2.3 Synchronized Multi-Track Playback Mode: - Motivation and Use: The second mode, called “MultiTrack MP3 Sync”, addresses scenarios where pre-composed audio materials need to be distributed and played in sync on multiple devices. For example, a piece might have several distinct audio stems or parts that are meant to be spatialized by having different performers’ phones each play one part. This mode turns the web app into a networked multi-track player, effectively a decentralized backing track system for ensembles or sound installations. - Slot Assignment and File Distribution: Explain how the system manages tracks and players. We define a fixed number of slots (e.g., 8 slots for 8 parts) on the server[26]. Each slot can have an MP3 file assigned, and each player is dynamically assigned to the lowest-numbered free slot when they join[26]. This mapping persists even if players disconnect: a slot “remembers” its assigned track so that a new player taking that slot will inherit the track[27]. On the conductor’s UI for this mode, there is a grid of slots showing slot index, the player name occupying it (or “empty”), and the filename of the audio assigned to that slot[28]. The conductor can upload or drag-and-drop an MP3 to each slot to assign a track[29]. When a file is assigned, the server stores it (with a unique fileId) and signals the corresponding player’s client to download and preload the audio. Player clients fetch the MP3 (via an HTTP endpoint), then decode it into an AudioBuffer using the Web Audio API, and finally report back a “ready” status to the server[30]. The conductor’s interface indicates which slots are ready (file loaded) so they know when all players can start playback[29]. This preloading step ensures that when we hit play, each client can start immediately without network delay. - Conductor Controls (Playback & Sync): Detail the playback controls available: Start (Play), Stop, and an optional “Start at [t] seconds” seek control[31]. The conductor can set a seek position (default 0) to begin from a specific timestamp in the tracks (useful for rehearsing or jumping to a section). When the conductor presses Play, the server doesn’t fire playback instantaneously; instead, it calculates a future start time a short interval ahead (e.g. 2 seconds from now)[32]. It then broadcasts a play message to all players containing: a unique play session ID, the chosen start position (seek time), and the scheduled server start timestamp[32]. Thanks to the earlier clock sync, each client can translate that server start time to its local time. The client computes the delta until start (taking its offset into account)[33] and uses AudioBufferSourceNode.start() to schedule its track to play at the exact synchronized moment[34]. All devices thus begin playback in unison, typically within a few milliseconds of each other, which is perceptually simultaneous. If a client’s track was not ready or if the seek time is beyond the track’s length, that client will simply remain silent or ignore the command[35] (ensuring one slow-to-load device won’t hold up others). The Stop command, when pressed, broadcasts an immediate stop signal, or alternatively can be handled by scheduling each source to stop. - Tight Timing and Network Alignment: Emphasize how we achieve tight sync over a network. We use the aforementioned ping/pong time offset to coordinate start times, similar to techniques in prior web-based music systems (e.g., the Soundworks framework, though not cited here). The scheduling on each client is done in the future (e.g., 2 seconds delay) to accommodate network lag: even the slowest client should receive the play message and schedule in time. We also implement an RTT (round-trip time) smoothing – if needed, mention that clients keep an average latency measure and the server chooses a safe lead time (like 2s) based on that[36]. Cite that this approach yields reliable sync: e.g., in tests we observed all phones starting within ~20 ms of each other, which is tighter than human ensemble accuracy. This effectively creates a virtual global clock for the piece’s start. We can reference that Jonathan Bell’s “Common Ground” piece similarly used a Node.js server on a Raspberry Pi to synchronize distributed scores for performers[37], validating that networked sync via web is viable in live settings. Our approach extends this by synchronizing audio playback itself. - Dynamic Joining & Fault Tolerance: Describe how the system handles players joining late or network hiccups. If a player connects (or reconnects) while a track is already playing, the server detects this and sends that player a special play message with an updated start time and seek position such that they jump in on the fly in sync with everyone else[38][39]. Specifically, the server computes the current playhead position (based on how long since the original start time) and instructs the new client to begin playback at that position after a brief buffer (e.g., 0.5s)[40]. This ensures continuity in case someone’s device refreshes or arrives late – they won’t wait until the next piece, but join the ongoing playback seamlessly. On the conductor side, if needed, they can also re-trigger Play to restart everyone. We also briefly mention that mobile browser audio policies require a user gesture before sounds can autoplay – hence the player interface in this mode (like the first mode) will prompt users to tap to enable audio if not already done[22]. Additionally, we limited file sizes (e.g., ~15 MB) to avoid long downloads[41] and designed the system for a reasonable ensemble size (e.g., up to 8–10 parts) to ensure network and CPU load remains manageable on phones.
(Optionally, we may include a short technical table or figure: e.g., a table of networking stats or a diagram of the play synchronization timeline, to visually support this description.)
3. Artistic Use Case: “Quantum Oscillator” Sonification Performance
Scenario Overview: To illustrate the tool in action, we describe a creative composition/performance that uses both modes of the system. The chosen example is a sonification piece based on the quantum harmonic oscillator concept. This piece was conceived to demonstrate how scientific data or models can drive musical processes in a networked setting, and how an audience or ensemble equipped with phones can collectively realize the piece.
Use of Real-Time Score Mode: In this scenario, the conductor interface was connected (via OSC) to a Max/MSP patch that simulates quantum oscillator dynamics. The patch continuously outputs parameter changes – for instance, treating each player as a “particle” with an associated frequency (pitch) and excitation rate (tempo). Using the OSC API mentioned earlier, these parameters are sent to the web server, effectively allowing Max to “play” the conductor’s role. As a result, each player’s phone received a live stream of pitch and interval updates corresponding to a unique quantum state. The phones generated tones accordingly, creating an evolving texture of quantized pitches. Because of the precise timing afforded by the audio score mode, the ensemble could achieve moments of synchronous events (e.g. all particles aligning) as well as independent rhythmic patterns – akin to the concept of particles oscillating at different frequencies yet occasionally in phase. The sound output (sine-like tones from Tone.js) directly represented the energy levels of the oscillator model, making the score both a scientific sonification and a musical piece.
Use of Synchronized Playback Mode: At certain sections of the piece, pre-composed audio material was introduced – for example, rich synthesized textures or processed noise representing complex quantum transitions. These were prepared as separate audio tracks (MP3 files) for each “particle” (player). Before the performance, the conductor uploaded these tracks into the system’s multi-track mode, assigning, say, 5 different textures to 5 player slots. When triggered during the performance, the Play command was used to launch all tracks in perfect synchrony, enveloping the space in a multi-channel soundscape. The tightly locked playback ensured that rhythmic structures in the pre-recorded materials (such as all tracks having a transient hit at the 10-second mark) occurred simultaneously on all devices, which is crucial for the intended musical impact. After this section, the conductor could switch the system back to the live synthesis mode (the players’ clients seamlessly switched scenes without needing a reconnect), and the piece continued with real-time algorithmic scoring.
Experience and Outcome: Describe qualitatively how this use case demonstrated the system’s capabilities. The performers/audience holding the phones experienced an interactive score – at times following live-generated audio cues and at other times being vehicles for synchronized fixed media. The transition between modes was smooth, controlled by the conductor’s scene selector. Artistically, this hybrid approach allowed structured playback to provide a fixed temporal framework, while the real-time mode allowed improvisatory or responsive elements around it. From a technical standpoint, the system proved robust: during a public demonstration with ~10 participants, all phones remained synchronized; latecomers who joined were able to partake immediately (the quantum model would assign them a state and/or they’d join the ongoing playback in progress). This example underscores how the platform can support sophisticated compositions that blend notation, improvisation, and electronics in a distributed manner.
Relevance to TENOR Themes: (Briefly tie back to artistic research context.) This use case, though not the core of the paper, shows the tool’s potential for composers: it opens new possibilities in line with TENOR’s interest in novel notation and performance technologies. By treating sound as the score and the web as the medium, composers can engage performers and even non-musician participants in ways previously difficult to achieve without custom infrastructure. The quantum sonification piece is just one instance; we imagine the system could enable anything from participatory sound installations to educational ensemble pieces where each student’s phone is their instrument.
4. Discussion
Technical Innovation and Challenges: Discuss how the presented system addresses key challenges in networked music performance. One major challenge is timing coordination across many devices. Our solution demonstrates that with careful use of Web Audio scheduling and WebSocket time sync, even browser-based ensembles can achieve precise timing (approaching the ideal of “perfect control over timing” noted by Bhagwati[2]). We compare this to traditional methods like everyone following a click-track or central conductor cues – our system essentially provides a distributed, programmable click-track (in the form of audio or scheduled playback) that can be much more complex than a metronome, and can dynamically change during performance. We also note that unlike purely audio-streaming solutions (e.g., sending a mix to all players), our approach sends control data and leverages local synthesis, drastically reducing network load and latency. This makes it scalable to large groups: whether it’s 5 or 50 players, the server is broadcasting small JSON messages rather than uncompressed audio streams.
Solving Network and Hardware Constraints: Acknowledge potential issues (network reliability, device heterogeneity) and how we mitigate them. For example, Wi-Fi or cellular delays could introduce slight flams in note onset; by scheduling in advance (especially in the playback mode), we minimize audible drift. The use of smoothed latency offset helps adapt to network changes on the fly[42][22]. We can reference Rebekah Wilson’s 2019 discussion on latency as a primary constraint in networked performances[43] – our design embraces this reality by building latency compensation into the score delivery. Another constraint is mobile hardware: different phones have different audio capabilities and clock precision. We found that modern smartphones are generally capable of sample-accurate scheduling via the Web Audio API; still, we kept the synthesis simple (basic waveforms) to avoid audio glitches. Battery and volume are practical considerations: an hour-long performance might drain a phone significantly if volume is high; we assume performances are shorter or that participants can charge devices if needed. These pragmatic observations could be useful for others attempting similar projects.
Comparison to Related Work: Place our tool in context with similar systems from prior art. For example, Decibel ScorePlayer (Hope et al. 2015) pioneered using networked tablets for graphic notation, and even added an OSC-driven canvas mode for generative scores[6]. Our system similarly enables dynamic score content delivered digitally, but shifts focus from visual graphics to auditory cues and uses the Web to eliminate platform dependencies. Common Ground (Bell & Wyatt 2020) showed that even head-mounted smartphones can display synced scores to coordinate music and movement[37]. We extend the philosophy of leveraging ubiquitous devices, but by generating sound directly on each device, we turn phones into both score and instrument simultaneously. This resonates with Schimana’s approach where electronic sound itself is the instruction to performers[1], though in our case the “performers” might simply be the devices producing the sound in situ (or performers could play along with the phones). We can also mention Soundworks (Schnell et al.), a framework for mobile web performances, as an inspiration for using web tech in collaborative music – but whereas Soundworks provides a general API, our contribution is a specific, ready-to-use tool tailored for scoring and conducting scenarios. Additionally, our multi-track mode is somewhat unique: while multi-speaker diffusion is common, doing it ad-hoc with audience phones often required manual methods or Bluetooth speakers; here we provide an automated, precise solution.
Creative and Practical Implications: Discuss how this tool opens up new possibilities for composers, performers, and event organizers. With a browser-based score, logistical barriers are lowered: “bring your own device” becomes the model, meaning a large ensemble or audience participation piece can be set up by simply sharing a URL. This could democratize certain performance practices – e.g., think of a crowd-based piece where everyone’s phone plays a role in a sound mass (a direction similar to works in the mobile music field, though our emphasis is on conductor-led scoring rather than user-generated input). The system can be used in education (as Eldridge’s work suggests, dynamic scores can help beginners stay in time[44][45]; our tool could be used in a classroom so each student’s phone guides them with sound). It also enables remote or distributed performance: because it runs on the internet, a conductor and players need not be co-located – though latency may increase over wider networks, the principle of time-aligning to a global clock still holds, and it could facilitate interesting geographically separated concerts. We consider whether this qualifies as a new form of notation or instrument: the conductor’s dashboard plus the network of phones constitute a novel performance ecosystem, merging notation delivery and sound production.
Limitations: It’s important to candidly note current limitations or areas for improvement. For instance, audio quality is limited by phone speakers; for nuanced music one might connect devices to external speakers or headphones. The system currently handles notated parameters of pitch and rhythm; it doesn’t (in this version) send more complex musical notation like melodic lines or lyrics – extending the interface for more complex scores (or integrating a visual notation alongside audio) could be explored. The multi-track mode assumes reasonably short, pre-prepared audio files; streaming very large files or live input wasn’t implemented. Also, network dependency: a robust local Wi-Fi or intranet is needed for best results; in unreliable networks, sync could break down if messages drop (though the system could recover on the next cycle or via re-sending state). These limitations suggest practical guidelines (we might include a note such as “for performances, use a dedicated router and ask participants to download the web app in advance to cache assets”).
Reflection on Aesthetics: Given TENOR’s blend of tech and artistic perspective, we could include a brief reflection: using sound as score and phones as instruments inherently shifts the aesthetic: it invites compositions that treat spatialized phone speakers as part of the sound design, and invites performers to engage more through listening than reading. This aligns with the idea of “coordinating by ear” described by Bhagwati[46] and the “heterophonic elastic timing” concept[47][48] – where each performer/device has slight leeway, yet a cohesive texture emerges. Our tool provides the infrastructure to experiment with these ideas easily.
5. Conclusion and Future Work
Summary: Reiterate the key points: We have introduced a web-based mobile audio scoring tool with two integrated modes to facilitate networked music performances. The system’s design achieves real-time control and accurate synchronization across devices, using only browsers and standard networking – making it a low-barrier solution for electronic and electroacoustic ensemble pieces. This addresses a noted challenge in the community: how to keep an ensemble together when spread across space or lacking traditional notation, by leveraging technology in an intuitive way[37][44]. The success of our implementation demonstrates that complex multi-user musical interactions can be realized without specialized hardware or software installations.
Contributions and Impact: Emphasize how this work expands the toolbox for composers and researchers. It combines ideas from prior audio scores and networked notation projects into a novel, practical platform. We anticipate it will be useful for large-scale participatory works, site-specific sound diffusion (using audience phones as distributed loudspeakers), and educational tools where instructors can “conduct” exercises through sound. By open-sourcing or sharing this platform (if applicable, mention plans for releasing the code or deploying a public version), we hope to contribute to the TENOR community and encourage new works that experiment with browser-based scores.
Future Work: Outline possible future developments. These might include: improving the musical expressivity of the real-time score mode (e.g., adding dynamic control, different timbres/instruments via Tone.js, or polyphony per device), implementing visual notation overlays (for example, showing a dynamic staff or graphical hints on the player screen alongside the audio cues, merging visual and audio scoring), scaling up to hundreds of players by optimizing network messaging or using peer-to-peer techniques, and conducting formal user studies or performances to gather feedback on the experience from both conductors and players. Another avenue is exploring remote internet performance scenarios more deeply – perhaps integrating WebRTC for those cases, or adaptive tempo mechanisms if latency is high (building on research like Wilson 2019 on latency-aware scores[43]). We also consider the creative possibility of audience members using their device’s sensors to send data back to the conductor, enabling a two-way interaction (though beyond current scope, it’s an exciting direction).
Closing Statement: End with a forward-looking statement linking back to the artistic context. For instance: In summary, the platform demonstrates how modern web technologies can serve musical notation and performance in innovative ways, turning the omnipresent smartphone into both score and instrument. We believe this approach lowers practical barriers and sparks new creative formats where composers can “write” with distributed sound and performers/audiences can participate in novel sonic experiences. By aligning technical innovation with musical thinking, the project embodies the spirit of TENOR – expanding what constitutes a score and how it can be realized in live performance.
Formatting and Template Considerations: - In preparing the camera-ready paper, we will follow the official TENOR 2025/2026 template (LaTeX or Word) for formatting[49]. The paper will be formatted in the standard two-column layout, likely with 10-point font and required margins, as per previous TENOR proceedings. All section headings (Introduction, System Design, etc.) will be clearly numbered and styled according to the template. We will include a concise abstract (100–150 words) at the beginning and a list of keywords if required by the template. Figures (such as an architecture diagram or screenshots of the interfaces) will be inserted with proper captions and references in the text, following template guidelines (e.g., centered in-column, with a figure number). We will ensure that any musical notation graphics or screenshots are high-contrast and sized for readability. All references will be formatted in the conference’s bibliography style (likely numeric citations [1,2,3] in-text, corresponding to a numbered reference list) – we have used placeholder citations 【#†LX-Y】 here to indicate supporting sources, which will be replaced with the final reference format. The length of the paper will be kept to around 3–4 pages of main content, not including references, to meet the expected submission length for a short TENOR paper (while the template allows up to ~12 pages for full papers[50], our target is a more concise presentation). We will also carefully adhere to any template specifics such as the placement of acknowledgments, the use of the TENOR copyright notice if required, and we will omit author names in the submission if it’s a double-blind review (ensuring anonymity by removing identifying information, per TENOR guidelines[51]). By closely following the provided template and stylistic requirements, we aim to produce a professional and polished paper ready for TENOR 2026.
