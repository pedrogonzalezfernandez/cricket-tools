Refactor the app’s navigation and UI to match the following mobile-first UX wireframe specification. Preserve existing functionality, but reorganize routes, screens, and components to fit this structure. Do not add new features.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (final)
- Home (route: /)
  - Live Play (route: /LivePlay)
    - Conductor (route: /LivePlay/Conductor)
    - Player (route: /LivePlay/Player)
  - MP3 Sync (route: /MP3Sync)
    - Conductor (route: /MP3Sync/Conductor)
    - Player (route: /MP3Sync/Player)

COPY (exact)
App title: "Cricket Tools"
Tagline (Home subtitle): "Utilities for online audio scoring on mobile devices"

Home buttons:
- "Live Play"
- "MP3 Sync"

Live Play subtitle:
- "Real-time score transmission."

MP3 Sync subtitle:
- "Synchronized audio playback."

Role labels and subtitles (used in both Live Play and MP3 Sync):
- Conductor — "Control the session."
- Player — "Follow the score."

SCREEN REQUIREMENTS

1) Home (/)
- Display heading: Cricket Tools
- Display subheading: Utilities for online audio scoring on mobile devices
- Two full-width buttons stacked vertically:
  - Primary: Live Play → /LivePlay
  - Secondary: MP3 Sync → /MP3Sync

2) Live Play (/LivePlay)
- Top navigation with back action to Home
- Heading: Live Play
- Subheading: Real-time score transmission.
- Two full-width stacked buttons, each with a one-line subtitle:
  - Primary: Conductor
    Subtitle: Control the session.
    → /LivePlay/Conductor
  - Secondary: Player
    Subtitle: Follow the score.
    → /LivePlay/Player

3) MP3 Sync (/MP3Sync)
- Top navigation with back action to Home
- Heading: MP3 Sync
- Subheading: Synchronized audio playback.
- Two full-width stacked buttons, each with a one-line subtitle:
  - Primary: Conductor
    Subtitle: Control the session.
    → /MP3Sync/Conductor
  - Secondary: Player
    Subtitle: Follow the score.
    → /MP3Sync/Player

4) Role Screens (4 routes)
- /LivePlay/Conductor
- /LivePlay/Player
- /MP3Sync/Conductor
- /MP3Sync/Player

Each role screen must:
- Include a top navigation/back action to its parent screen
- Display a minimal header indicating mode and role (e.g., "Live Play — Conductor")
- Retain any existing role-specific logic; if none exists, use a placeholder view that preserves navigation flow

UI CONSTRAINTS
- Mobile-first, portrait orientation
- Vertical layout with safe-area padding
- One primary action per screen
- No modal dialogs
- Subtitles should be visually secondary (smaller, lighter text)
- No decorative UI beyond headings, subtitles, and buttons

QUALITY CHECKS
- Ensure all routes are reachable via direct URL (deep linking)
- Remove unused routes, components, and navigation references
- Verify there are no broken imports or navigation loops
- Run/build to confirm the app works end-to-end after refactor
